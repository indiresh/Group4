Welcome to Build-a-Bot!

We're a team of four engineers, each with our own unique robot architecture, 
working constantly to create the best Build-a-Bot service in the nation. We 
were randomly sitting together one day playing with robots, creating them and
coming up with multiple ideas for robots. We came up with so many that 
we decided to put it to good use. Hence, we now have a company called Build-a-bot
to share with all of you.
<p>
But instead of talking about us, let's get to know you. Whether you have a 
passion for robots, enjoy building them, or are looking for something new to do, 
having knowledge about our Build-a-Bot service will satisfy your interests. 
It will give you the ability to build, program, and focus on robots 
in your free time. 
<p>
Build-a-Bot makes it easy to search through diverse robot products, read 
updates about new products, learn about different parts, provides tutorial about the actions 
robots are capable of, or just generally explore them. You'll love searching through the 
variety of robots and it can make one's life exciting! Think of using this 
Build-a-Bot as your own personal robot platform.
