Welcome to Build-a-Bot!

We�re a team of four engineers, each with our own unique robot architecture, 
working constantly to create the best Build-a-Bot service in the nation. We 
were randomly sitting together one day playing with robots, creating them and
coming up with multiple ideas of kinds of robots. We came up with so many that 
we needed to put it to good use. Hence, now have a company called Build-a-bot
to share with all of you.

But instead of talking about us, let�s get to know you. Whether you have a 
passion for robots, building them, or looking for something new to do, you
