Rosie is the ultimate maid robot that moves quickly around a home doing 
household chores such as cleaning, cooking dinner and washing dishes. 
Rosie has the heart of human being, and a soothing, reassuring voice. 
Rosie is the soft, cuddly robot that can be stored in your closet any time. 
Rosie is a soft, cushioned, squishy robot so that it is child proof around 
the house. This makes it safe for kids in case they run into Rosie accidently.
Rosie’s soft grips also prevent breaking eggs or even wine glasses. There are 
also touchable sensors on the fingertips to handle a variety of delicate objects 
and can act like human hands. 
<p>
Rosie has a human-like body that has a rotating head, arms, and legs. She has 3-D 
vision to always spot chores that need to be done. It allows her to recognize 
people and be able to turn on an object, such as a microwave or coffee maker 
when it senses it is about to be used. Generally, it is trained to mimic human 
movements and apply them before the human can. Rosie’s purpose is to make your 
life easier, and allow you to have more time to do other things. She will keep
your house spot clean, prepare all kinds of things for you, and just overall 
be the best maid you could ever have.
