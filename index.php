<h3>2012 Homemade Robot Contest Winner Choosen</h3>
After much debate here at Build-A-Bot, we have finally picked a winner for our annual Homemade Robot Contest. This year’s contest was the closest to date, with many recounts and even a few brawls breaking out between opposing camps. The 2012 winner comes to us from The Orkin Man. The Orkin Man’s robot, the Bugginator, was a modified Roomba. His robot main purpose is the complete and utter extermination of bugs from the household. Featuring a set of eight spider-like legs for great horizontal and vertical mobility, this bug terminator bot uses motion and heat sensing technology to locate unwanted insects. After acquiring its target the bot quickly swoops in to disorient its victim with differing sound frequencies and then zaps the target with a laser.  The Bugginator also features a collection system for cleaning up fried bug corpses. The easy to use interface and customization carried the Bugginator to victory in this year’s contest.

<h3>Ultimate Defensive Robot Announced</h3>
We are pleased to announce that one of our most experienced and successful design teams, S.H.I.E.L.D., will be undertaking a new project. The team is led by distinguished robot designer, Nick Fury. Mr. Fury has long said the main objective of his team is to protect the world. In announcing S.H.I.E.L.D.’s new undertaking, Mr. Fury commented, “The invasion of the Chitauri aliens made it clear that Earth can be in danger from foes not even known to us. We must be prepared at all times to defend ourselves. Therefore, my group has decided to create a bot that can provide unprecedented protection to its owner.”
<p>
Mr. Fury was very sparse on providing more details about the robot other than hinting that a breakthrough in metallurgy and a revamped defensive software package will be main components of the new bot. When asked if their new defensive robot could withstand the Unstoppable Force, Mr. Fury scoffed, “People, please. We all know what happened to the Juggernaut. He claimed to be unstoppable and we all know what happened to him. Nothing is unstoppable.” We, here at Build-A-Bot, wait in eager anticipation of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s completion of their latest project; rumors of a show match between their creation and the Unstoppable Force are already running rampant.

<h3>Legion of Doom Joins Build-A-Bot</h3>
We are pleased to announce an addition to our development department! Over the past few months, we have been in talks with a brilliant group of designers led by Lex Luther. Mr. Luther’s group, known as the Legion of Doom, has been on the cutting edge of weapons development for the past few years. We, here at Build-A-Bot, have been impressed by their continued dedication to their goals and resiliency when met with failure. 
<p>
Legion of Doom members were enthusiastic to join the Build-A-Bot family and gain access to our advanced robotic models. Upon arrival at the Build-A-Bot development facility, they quickly locked themselves into their lab and have been hard at work since. While Mr. Luther has been tight lipped about his team’s first project, he did let slip that he planned on “developing a force to take over the world.” While Build-A-Bot does not condone world-take over, we are eager to see what results from the integration of Build-A-Bot robot technology with Legion of Doom weaponry.
